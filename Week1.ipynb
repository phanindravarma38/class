    "\n",
    "Assume that our input is stored in an array **`a`**. We would like to implement an algorithm that proceeds from one **stage** to the next while processing **one element per stage**. In particular, the algorithm will maintain a certain **invariant condition** at the beginning of a loop (each stage is one iteration of the loop) using three *variables* to mark positions in the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "* index `i` marks a **block of zeros** in the prefix `a[0:i]` of the array\n",
    "* index `k` marks **a block of twos** in the suffix `a[k:]` of the array\n",
    "* index `j`, with `i`$<=$`j`$<=$`k`, is such that the slice `a[i:j]` is a **block of ones**\n",
    "* the slice a[j:k] is **as yet not processed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we initialize `i` to 0, `j` to 0 and `k` to the length of the array `a`, the invariant will be true in the beginning. Yoiu now need to figure out the loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the **next element** to be processed in each iteration will be the element **`a[j]`**: depending on whether `a[j]` equals 0, 1 or 2, you will need to update `i` and `k` appropriately within the loop. Make sure you understand how maintaining invariant condition leaves you with a sorted array at the end of the last stage (you will need to figure out the **loop termination condition**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to complete the following block of code so that executing the function **`dnflag`** on any input array of 0s, 1s and 2s will return an array that has 0s, 1s and 2s arranged in that order.

Searching was described in the previous paragraph: it involves walking through the list until either the value is found or the end of the list is reached.

Among all the methods, **delete** is trickiest: while the general idea is to search until found and then delete, you have to **splice out** the node that needs to be deleted which involves remembering the identity of the *previous node* encountered in the search. \n"
